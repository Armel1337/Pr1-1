			<p>Bio this person</p>
			<p class="bruh">Obito Uchiha (う ち は オ ビ ト, Obito Uchiha) was a shinobi from the Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. It
				was believed that he died during the Third Shinobi World War, and that his only legacy was the Sharingan,
				which
				he gave to his friend Kakashi Hatake.</p>

			<h2 class="oreo">Interesting Facts</h2>
			<ul align="left" type="circle">
				<li>Obito was born on February 10th.</li>
				<li>Possessing the Rinnegan, Obito used it to create his version of Six Paths, consisting of six
					reincarnated
					jinchūriki with their tailed beasts sealed back into their bodies.</li>
				<li>The right side of Obito's body was badly damaged during the Third Shinobi World War, after which he is
					rescued by Madara, who replaces his destroyed right side with an artificial body of one of the White
					Zetsu
					clones. Thanks to this, his chakra reserve is increased, he can use Wood Release, since the clones have
					been
					linked to Hashirama Senju's DNA.</li>
				<li>When he first met Madara, Obito referred to him as "my honorable ancestor", which could mean that Obito
					is
					a direct descendant of Madara.</li>
